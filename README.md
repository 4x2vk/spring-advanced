# Spring Advanced
A backend service built with Spring Boot, designed to manage authentication, task operations, and user interactions.

## Project Overview

This repository was initialized and debugged from a broken state. The application now runs successfully after resolving multiple critical issues across configuration, logic, and testing layers.

### Completed Tasks

| Level | Task Description |
|-------|------------------|
| Lv 0  | Fixed application startup errors and configuration issues |
| Lv 1  | Restored and re-implemented `AuthUserArgumentResolver` |
| Lv 2  | Refactored service logic for early returns, removed unnecessary `else` blocks, and moved password validation to DTO |
| Lv 3  | Resolved N+1 query problem using `@EntityGraph` in `TodoRepository` |
| Lv 4  | Corrected and improved test cases across multiple services |

## â™» Key Improvements

### Error Resolution

- Fixed multiple startup errors including misconfigured beans and missing dependencies.
- Added `application.yml` with proper JWT key setup.

### ArgumentResolver

- Re-implemented `AuthUserArgumentResolver` to correctly inject authenticated user context into controller methods.

### Code Refactoring

- **Early Return Logic**: Prevented unnecessary password encoding by checking for duplicate emails first.
- **Simplified Conditionals**: Removed nested `else` blocks for better readability in `WeatherClient`.
- **Validation Shift**: Moved password validation logic from service layer to DTO using annotations like `@Size`, `@Pattern`, and `@NotBlank`.

### Performance Optimization

- Replaced JPQL `fetch join` with `@EntityGraph` to resolve N+1 query issues in `TodoService`.

### Test Coverage

Fixed broken test cases:
- `PassEncoderTest` now correctly verifies password matching.
- `ManagerServiceTest` and `CommentServiceTest` updated to reflect correct exception handling.
- Renamed misleading test method names to match actual behavior.
- Adjusted service logic to ensure tests pass under updated conditions.
